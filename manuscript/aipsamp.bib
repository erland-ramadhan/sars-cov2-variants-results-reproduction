abstract = {The widespread availability of large amounts of genomic data on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has created an opportunity for researchers to analyze the disease at a level of detail, unlike any virus before it. On the one hand, this will help biologists, policymakers, and other authorities to make timely and appropriate decisions to control the spread of the coronavirus. On the other hand, such studies will help to more effectively deal with any possible future pandemic. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus contains different variants, each of them having different mutations, performing any analysis on such data becomes a difficult task, given the size of the data. It is well known that much of the variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome happens disproportionately in the spike region of the genome sequence&mdash;the relatively short region which codes for the spike protein(s). In this paper, we propose a robust feature-vector representation of biological sequences that, when combined with the appropriate feature selection method, allows different downstream clustering approaches to perform well on a variety of different measures. We use such proposed approach with an array of clustering techniques to cluster spike protein sequences in order to study the behavior of different known variants that are increasing at a very high rate throughout the world. We use a k-mers based approach first to generate a fixed-length feature vector representation of the spike sequences. We then show that we can efficiently and effectively cluster the spike sequences based on the different variants with the appropriate feature selection. Using a publicly available set of SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences, we perform clustering of these sequences using both hard and soft clustering methods and show that, with our feature selection methods, we can achieve higher F1 scores for the clusters and also better clustering quality metrics compared to baselines.},

abstract = {Accurate short term electricity load forecasting is crucial for efficient operations of the power sector. Predicting loads at a fine granularity (e.g. households) is made challenging due to a large number of (known or unknown) factors affecting power consumption. At larger scales (e.g. clusters of consumers), since the inherent stochasticity and fluctuations are averaged out, the problem becomes substantially easier. In this work we propose a method for short term (e.g. hourly) load forecasting at fine scale (households). Our method use hourly consumption data for a certain period (e.g. previous year) and predict hourly loads for the next period (e.g. next 6 months). We do not use any non-calendar information, hence our technique is applicable to any locality and dataset. We evaluate effectiveness of our technique on three benchmark datasets from Sweden, Australia, and Ireland.},

abstract = {Abstract Ridge regression is a popular parameter estimation method used to address the collinearity problem frequently arising in multiple linear regression. The formulation of the ridge methodology is reviewed and properties of the ridge estimates capsulated. In particular, four rationales leading to a regression estimator of the ridge form are summarized. Algebraic properties of the ridge regression coefficients are given, which elucidate the behavior of a ridge trace for small values of the ridge parameter (i.e., close to the least squares solution) and for large values of the ridge parameter. Further properties involving coefficient sign changes and rates-of-change, as functions of the ridge parameter, are given for specific correlation structures among the independent variables. These results help relate the visual behavior of a ridge trace to the underlying structure of the data. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.
